# CHEM4310-Programming and Machine Learning in Chemistry
## Repository Overview
This repository contains projects and computational work completed for CHEM 4310: Programming and Machine Learning in Chemistry (Spring 2024) at The University of Texas at Dallas, under the instruction of Dr. Cormac Toher.

The collection demonstrates competencies in applying computational methods and machine learning techniques to chemical problems, including:

- Development of regression models for structure-property relationships
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms (Random Forests, SVMs, Gaussian Processes)
- Feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization for chemical property prediction
- Analysis of zincblende-structure materials and electronic band gap prediction
- Data visualization and statistical analysis of computational chemistry results

## Repository Status
This portfolio is currently a work in progress (as of April 2025). I am actively refining the code organization, improving documentation, and enhancing visualizations. While the core functionality and analyses from course assignments are complete, I am developing these materials into more comprehensive project demonstrations. Check back regularly for updates!

### Current Development Focus:
- Refactoring code into more modular, object-oriented structure
- Enhancing documentation with detailed explanations and usage examples
- Creating additional visualizations for clearer result interpretation
- Consolidating related assignments into cohesive project workflows

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming for computational chemistry applications
- Scikit-Learn implementation for machine learning models
- Data preprocessing and feature selection for chemical datasets
- Model evaluation and validation techniques
- Quantitative performance assessment and optimization
